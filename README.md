# Cauldron-APC

### Things to remember / Rules
- Each participant is allowed to add up to 12 or 13 mods during their turn.
  - Each turn lasts for 10 days.
    - The current holder of the pack is allowed to end their turn early and pass the pack to the next person on the list.
  - People whoose spot on the list is an even number can add up to 12 mods. (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
  - People whoose spot on the list is an odd number can add up to 13 mods. (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
  - We agreed to have MTLib, Craft Tweaker, Mod Tweaker, FTBQuests, JEI and FoamFix in the pack from the start which means that they do not count towards the mod total.
  - Library mods, core mods and mod which do not add content will count as 1/3 instead of 1 mod.
    - Ore Excavation and Ore Excavation Intergration are an exception and together count as 1.
- Removing mods which have been added by previous participants is not allowed.
  - The only exception to this is if the mod crashes the game or presents major issues.
- Removing / Editing lines of scripts which have been created by other participants is not allowed.
  - Unless the script presents major issues or simply is not functional due to errors.
  - Everyone is allowed to add lines to already existing scripts when their turn comes as long as those lines do not make the script les functional.
- Mod configs can only be edited by the person who added the mod.
  - The configs might be modified by others if they are faulty.
  - Everyone is allowed to use configs to register recipes when their turn comes but not remove recipes made by others.
    - If a config file has default recipes, they may be removed with permission from the person who added the mod.
- Making items and/or recipes secret (not visible in JEI) is not allowed until the pack is ready for release.
  - This rule exists so we can all keep track with what the previous pariticpant has added/registered
